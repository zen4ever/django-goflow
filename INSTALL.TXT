- sampleproject: a turn-key, easy-to-start goflow project

- leavedemo:     goflow demo project

- leave:         fastcgi deployment (on alwaysdata.net)


2. Requirements:

- Python 2.4+
- Django 1.0 (SVN)

3. Install instructions:

leavedemo project:

- cd leavedemo
  > create the database with command "python manage.py syncdb --noinput"
  > don't create the admin account, because
    leave demo data and all users required for playing with it will
    be created at this stage.
 
- superuser is "admin" with password "open"


sampleproject project:

- install flags application in the sampleproject directory
- move "flags/img/flags" directory in the "static" directory
- cd sampleproject 
  > create the database with command "python manage.py syncdb --noinput"
- superuser is  "admin" with password "admin"


4. Test instructions:

- run "python manage.py runserver" (with goflow in python path)

- admin interface: http://localhost:8000/leave/admin

- leave demo:      http://localhost:8000/leave/


5. deployment instruction on a factcgi server online (like www.alwaysdata.net)

- copy get_svn_leavdemo.sh on the server and run
